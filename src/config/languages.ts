-- This is a comprehensive IT Store Sales Database
-- Use the database schema viewer to explore table structures

-- Basic queries to get started:

-- 1. View all products with their categories and suppliers
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    s.supplier_name,
    p.unit_price,
    p.stock_quantity
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
JOIN suppliers s ON p.supplier_id = s.supplier_id
ORDER BY p.product_name;

-- 2. Find products with low stock (below reorder level)
SELECT 
    product_name,
    stock_quantity,
    reorder_level,
    CASE 
        WHEN stock_quantity <= reorder_level THEN 'Low Stock'
        WHEN stock_quantity = 0 THEN 'Out of Stock'
        ELSE 'In Stock'
    END as stock_status
FROM products
WHERE stock_quantity <= reorder_level
ORDER BY stock_quantity;

-- 3. Customer order summary
SELECT 
    c.first_name + ' ' + c.last_name as customer_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- 4. Top selling products by revenue
SELECT TOP 10
    p.product_name,
    c.category_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as total_sold,
    SUM(oi.total_price) as total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.unit_price) as avg_price

JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, c.category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- 5. Order status breakdown
SELECT 
    order_status,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_status
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- 6. Monthly sales analysis
SELECT 
    FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') as month,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(MONTH, -12, GETDATE())
GROUP BY FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY month DESC;

-- 7. Product category performance
SELECT 
    c.category_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_id) as product_count,
    SUM(p.stock_quantity) as total_stock,
    AVG(p.unit_price) as avg_price,

FROM categories c
LEFT JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- 8. Customer geographic analysis
SELECT 
    state,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) as customer_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.state IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.state
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- 9. Shipping method analysis
SELECT 
    sm.method_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.shipping_cost) as avg_shipping_cost
FROM orders o
JOIN shipping_methods sm ON o.shipping_method_id = sm.shipping_method_id
GROUP BY sm.shipping_method_id, sm.method_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;

-- 10. Payment method analysis
SELECT 
    pm.method_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders o
JOIN payment_methods pm ON o.payment_method_id = pm.payment_method_id
GROUP BY pm.payment_method_id, pm.method_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- 11. Using the pre-built views
SELECT * FROM product_inventory WHERE stock_status = 'Low Stock';
SELECT * FROM order_summary ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
SELECT * FROM top_products ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;`
